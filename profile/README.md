### Cyber Security

We understand the importance of addressing security concerns promptly and thoroughly. Upon receiving reports, we allocate the necessary resources to assess and resolve the issues.

We appreciate reports from various sources, including independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, and customers who are concerned about product security. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any of our products, we encourage you to notify us at cybersecurity@arcade1up.com.

When submitting a report, please provide as much information as possible, including:

- ⁠Affected product(s) and software version(s)
- ⁠Description of the issue and its potential impact
- ⁠Instructions on how to reproduce the issue
- ⁠Suggestions for mitigation or remediation actions, if applicable

Upon receiving a report, we will initiate an investigation with our internal security team. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will promptly take the necessary corrective actions to resolve the issue and prevent future occurrences.

We are committed to keeping you informed throughout the process, although please note that the investigation may require some time to complete. Generally, you will receive confirmation from us within 7 working days and get informed of the handling progress based on the actual situation.

We commit to addressing confirmed security vulnerabilities in our products for a minimum of 2 years after the initial product release date.
